[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/albinotonnina/tdd-javascript-coding-dojo.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

## Roman Numerals Kata

###Red green refactor principle:
    Write a minimum test that fails.
    Write the minimum code to pass the test.
    Refactor


###Common mistakes:
    beginners usually forget about important things:
    the minimum qualifier is not optional, it is mandatory for doing TDD the proper way.
    This can help developing with baby steps.
    Baby step: that amount of coding which can be done within 30 seconds
    Never forget to check the failing test, always see the red test.
    refactoring part often skipped
